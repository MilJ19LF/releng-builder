    # Features to install
    # We do not need to explicitly install restconf here (which is not brought in by the clustering-test-app)
    # because this project will only create the -all- job which will automatically install the compatible with
    # all feature set. That feature set will bring in restconf, which is required by the CSIT suites. If/When
    # the -only- version of this job is brought back, we'll need to take that in to consideration.
